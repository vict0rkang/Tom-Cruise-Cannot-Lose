    "Microsoft has been suffering from a severe case of FOMO (Fear-Of-Missing-Out) as they've watched many of their competitors succeed in opening up their own movie studios and creating original video content! Microsoft wants in on the action and is now opening their own movie studio! I've been tasked with providing critical data-based market research to ensure that Microsoft's first movie will be a global success!\n",

    "#### Primary Objectives and Qualifications:\n",
    "1. Explore and analyze what **types** of films are **currently** doing the **best at the box office**.\n",
    "* The key terms here in bold must first be defined. For this Project, they shall be defined as follows:\n",
    ">* **Types**: There are many ways to classify or categorize films, most common being by Genre. We can also categorize movies by their budget range, ie. big budget vs small budget.\n",
    ">* **Currently**: Because Microsoft asked for \"currently\", we know we should only consider modern movies in our upcoming analysis. Exactly how modern will be influenced by our available data. Specific Date Range To Be Determined! But we should at minimum aim to include movies released this year (2022)!\n",
    ">* **Best at the Box Office**: \"Best\" will be defined solely by the financial performance of movies at the Worldwide Box Office. To measure financial performance, we will explore the Worldwide Box Office Gross of movies and compare it to their Production Budgets to calculate the *Profit/Loss* and *Return-On-Investment* metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* In short, our first objective is to determine which Genres and Budget Ranges of modern movies have produced the highest profit and return-on-investment for their movie studios! \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide (3) actionable insights / concrete business recommendations based on the analysis. \n",
    "* We plan to provide budget range recommendations and how budgets could have a relationship to financial success.\n",
    "* Genre\n",
    "* Recommendations for cast and crew! Actor, Actress, Director, and Writer recommendations.\n",

Judging by the fact that half the data from 2019 and almost all the data from 2020 onwards has no runtime data, this makes us assume that this database must have been extracted from IMDB sometime around 2019.
