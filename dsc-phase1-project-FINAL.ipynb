    "\n",
    "In today's modern world, especially during and after the pandemic, the movie industry is mightily struggling to stay afloat and get back to normal. A single bad movie could spell the financial doom of an entire studio! That's why every decision a studio makes has taken on exponential weight and risk. That is why most movie studios are turning to data science to help guide their decision making! In this notebook, financial performance data from publicly-available online movie databases will be analyzed to identify only the most successful movies out of the most recent 5000 released movies to-date. Relationships, trends, and metrics will be explored to produce budget, genre, and cast and crew recommendations that will give a new movie studio their best chance at making their first financially successful debut movie!\n"

    "Microsoft has been suffering from a severe case of FOMO (Fear-Of-Missing-Out) as they've watched many of their competitors succeed in opening up their own movie studios and creating original video content! Microsoft wants in on the action and is now opening their own movie studio! I've been tasked with providing critical data-based market research to ensure that Microsoft's first movie will be a global success!\n",

    "1. Explore and analyze what **types** of films are **currently** doing the **best at the box office**.\n",
    "* The key terms here in bold must first be defined. For this Project, they shall be defined as follows:\n",
    ">* **Types**: There are many ways to classify or categorize films, most common being by Genre. We can also categorize movies by their budget range, ie. big budget vs small budget.\n",
    ">* **Currently**: Because Microsoft asked for \"currently\", we know we should only consider modern movies in our upcoming analysis. Exactly how modern will be influenced by our available data. Specific Date Range To Be Determined! But we should at minimum aim to include movies released this year (2022)!\n",
    ">* **Best at the Box Office**: \"Best\" will be defined solely by the financial performance of movies at the Worldwide Box Office. To measure financial performance, we will explore the Worldwide Box Office Gross of movies and compare it to their Production Budgets to calculate the *Profit/Loss* and *Return-On-Investment* metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* In short, our first objective is to determine which Genres and Budget Ranges of modern movies have produced the highest profit and return-on-investment for their movie studios! \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide **(3) actionable insights / concrete business recommendations** based on the analysis. \n",
    "* We plan to provide budget range recommendations and how budgets could have a relationship to financial success.\n",
    "* Genre Recommendations\n",
    "* Recommendations for cast and crew! Actor, Actress, Director, and Writer recommendations.\n",

Judging by the fact that half the data from 2019 and almost all the data from 2020 onwards has no runtime data, this makes us assume that this database must have been extracted from IMDB sometime around 2019.

One might want to conclude that at a certain point, you can guarantee an amount of profit per budget following the linearly sloped bound line. However, that is wrong. The lower asymptote is an artifical bound we created when we filtered the movie data set to only the visualize successful movies! As a comparison, see the plot of our **test2** dataframe, which has all 5000 recent movies, successful and unsuccessful. For what it's worth, a linear correlation seems to still exist, but not as strong and not as positive."
